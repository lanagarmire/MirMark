MirMark Installation


Please see the HTML/index.html file for proper installation instructions.

A preconfigured version is available through Dockerhub (see instructions):
   docker pull dgarmire/mirmark
Note: Docker is also a public repository.

Note on installing from GitHub:
1) The tar file MirMarkRNApl.tgz is generated from the RNApl directory by:
     tar zcvf MirMarkRNApl.tgz --transform='s/RNApl/MirMarkRNApl/' RNApl
2) The tar file MirMark.tgz is generated from the Core directory.
     tar zcvf MirMark.tgz --transform='s/Core/MirMark/' Core 
3) The tar file MirMarkTest.tgz is generated from the Test directory.
     tar zcvf MirMarkTest.tgz --transform='s/Test/MirMarkTest/' Test

Second Note:
1) Ensure you install weka.jar properly so it is found on your java classpath.
2) Ensure miranda is found on your path: e.g., `which miranda` should work.
